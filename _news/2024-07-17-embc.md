I presented a research poster at the 2024 IEEE Engineering Medicine and Biology Conference at Orlando, FL, USA. The poster was titled `Wirless Earphone-Based Real-Time monitoring of Breathing Exercises: A Deep Learning Approach`. The research was conducted at the [Mechatronics, Controls, and Robotics Lab](http://mechatronics.engineering.nyu.edu/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. The study was approved by the NYU Institutional Review Board (IRB-FY2020-4198). Additonal information about the study can be found [here](/projects/audio-breathing).
