Hi and welcome to my website! :wave:

I'm a **Research Scientist** at the [Mechatronics, Controls, and Robotics Lab](http://mechatronics.engineering.nyu.edu/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, specializing in digital health, ambient assistive technology, and telerehabilitation, particularly for the geriatric population. My research leverages connected and wearable devices, alongside commercially available technologies, to improve healthcare outcomes. My work spans robotics, mechatronics, wireless networks, augmented/virtual reality, computer vision, audio, and deep learning, with contributions to research in stroke and lymphedema rehabilitation.

With a strong background in robotics, electrical, mechanical, and mechatronics engineering, I specialize in collecting data from human subjects under IRB protocols, analyzing that data, training deep learning models, and designing wearable sensors. My experience includes designing and developing wearable inertial sensors for motion capture, developing control systems for robotic manipulators, and implementing computer vision and audio analysis for human-robot interaction. Sometimes, I also design and fabricate robotic systems for theatrical productions :performing_arts:, and build hexapods :octopus:, which is a lot of fun!
