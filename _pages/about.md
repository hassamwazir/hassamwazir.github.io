Hi and welcome to my website! :wave:

I'm a **Research Scientist** at the [Mechatronics, Controls, and Robotics Lab](http://mechatronics.engineering.nyu.edu/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My research focuses on leveraging connected and wearable devices and commercially available technologies for digital health and telerehabilitation, with a particular emphasis on the geriatric population. My work spans various domains, including robotics, mechatronics, wireless networks, computer vision, audio analysis, deep learning, and range of motion assessment. Additionally, I have contributed to research efforts in stroke and lymphedema rehabilitation.

I have a strong background in electrical, mechanical, and mechatronics engineering, with a focus on robotics and automation. My experience includes designing and developing wearable inertial sensors for motion capture, developing control systems for robotic manipulators, and implementing computer vision and audio analysis for human-robot interaction. I have also designed and fabricated robotic systems for theatrical productions. My research interests include digital health, telerehabilitation, robotics, automation, and assistive technology.
