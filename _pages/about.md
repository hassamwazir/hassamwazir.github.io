Hi and welcome to my website! :wave:  

I'm the **Chief Engineer at Innomune Biologics Brooklyn**, where I lead the **design, development, and testing of biosensors for disease detection**. I oversee all phases of sensor engineering, including **system design, calibration protocols, analytical data interpretation, and performance validation**.  

My research work focuses on **digital health, wearable technology, and telerehabilitation** for the **geriatric population**, leveraging **connected devices** to improve healthcare outcomes. This includes research in **stroke and lymphedema rehabilitation**, with applications in **robotics, mechatronics, wireless networks, AR/VR, computer vision, audio, and deep learning**.  

I also specialize in **human-subject data collection under IRB protocols**, **sensor design**, and **AI-driven data interpretation**.
Sometimes, I also **design and fabricate robotic systems for theatrical productions** :performing_arts:, and **build hexapods** :octopus:, which is a lot of fun!
