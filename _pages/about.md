I recently graduated with a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Digital Health and Telerehabilitation, from the [Mechatronics, Controls, and Robotics Lab](http://mechatronics.engineering.nyu.edu/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My research focuses on leveraging connected devices and commercially available technologies for digital health and telerehabilitation, with a particular emphasis on the geriatric population. My work encompasses various domains, including robotics, mechatronics, Wi-Fi localization, audio analysis, deep learning, and range of motion assessment. Additionally, I have contributed to research efforts in stroke and lymphedema rehabilitation.
