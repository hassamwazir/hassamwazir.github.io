I'm a Ph.D. in Mechanical engineering fromthe [Mechatronics, Controls, and Robotics Lab](http://mechatronics.engineering.nyu.edu/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My research focuses on utilizing connected devices and commercially available technologies for digital health and telerehabilitation, particularly for the geriatric population. My work spans several domains, including Wi-Fi localization, audio analysis, deep learning, and range of motion assessment. Additionally, I have contributed to research efforts in stroke and lymphedema rehabilitation.
