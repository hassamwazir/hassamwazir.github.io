I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [Mechatronics, Controls, and Robotics Lab](http://mechatronics.engineering.nyu.edu/) at NYU Tandon School of Engineering. My research focuses on the utilization of connected devices and commercially available technologies and repurpose them for digital health and telerehabilitation in the context of the geriatric population. My research includes several domains such as Wi-Fi localization, audio analysis, deep learning, and range of motion assessment. Furthermore, I have contributed to research efforts focusing on stroke and lymphadema rehabilitation.
