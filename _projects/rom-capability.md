## Abstract

> Many neurological conditions, e.g., a stroke, can cause patients to experience upper limb (UL) motor impairments that hinder their daily activities. For such patients, while rehabilitation therapy is key for regaining autonomy and restoring mobility, its long-term nature entails ongoing time commitment and it is often not sufficiently engaging. Virtual reality (VR) can transform rehabilitation therapy into engaging game-like tasks that can be tailored to patient-specific activities, set goals, and provide rehabilitation assessment. Yet, most VR systems lack built-in methods to track progress over time and alter rehabilitation programs accordingly. We propose using arm kinematic modeling and capability maps to allow a VR system to understand a user’s physical capability and limitation. Next, we suggest two use cases for the VR system to utilize the user’s capability map for tailoring rehabilitation programs. Finally, for one use case, it is shown that the VR system can emphasize and assess the use of specific UL joints.
> Clinical relevance—This paper’s VR-based system can tailor a rehabilitation tool to a user’s capability and limit.
