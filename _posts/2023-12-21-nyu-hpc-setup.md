This is a guide for logging into the NYU HPC cluster and streamlining that process.

- The usual way to access the NYU Greene HPC cluster is via SSH. This information is taken from the official [NYU HPC website](https://sites.google.com/nyu.edu/nyu-hpc/hpc-systems/greene/getting-started?authuser=0#h.niitlb309yhv).

  - Simply open a terminal (Linux, Mac) or the Command Prompt (Windows 10) and enter the commands:

    ```
    ssh <netid>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu ## you can skip this step if you  are on the NYU Network or using the NYU VPN
    ssh <netid>@greene.hpc.nyu.edu
    ```

    where `<netid>` is your NYU NetID. You will be prompted for your NYU NetID password. Enter it and you will be logged into the login node.

- SSH keys can be set up as follows so that you don't have to enter your password every time:

- On your local machine, generate a public/private key pair by running the command `ssh-keygen -t rsa` in a terminal. You will be prompted for a location to save the key pair. The default location is `~/.ssh/id_rsa` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` for the private and public keys, respectively. You can just press enter to accept the default location.

- Copy the public key to the login node by running the command `ssh-copy-id <netid>@login.greene.hpc.nyu.edu`. You will be prompted for your password. Enter it and the public key will be copied to the login node.

- Now you can log into the login node without entering your password by running the command `ssh <netid>@login.greene.hpc.nyu.edu`.

- As a final step, you can add the following lines to your `~/.ssh/config` file to make logging in easier:

  ```
  # Host for ssh'ing into the Greene cluster when on the NYU network
  Host greene
    HostName greene.hpc.nyu.edu
    User <netid>

  # Host for 'tunneling' into the hpc when logging in from outside of the NYU network (i.e. at home)
  Host hpcgwtunnel
    HostName gw.hpc.nyu.edu
    ForwardX11 no
    LocalForward 8025 greene.hpc.nyu.edu:22
    User <netid>

  # Host for sshing into the greene cluster when tunneled in from outside of the NYU network (i.e. at home)
  Host greenetunnel
    HostName localhost
    Port 8025
    ForwardX11 yes
    User <netid>
  ```

**Note:** In Windows 10, the `~/.ssh/config` file is located at `C:\Users\<username>\.ssh\config`.

Now you can log into the login node by simply running the command `ssh greene`.
