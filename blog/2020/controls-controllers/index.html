In this post, we will discuss the common types of controllers used in classical control systems.</p> <h2 id="controllers">Controllers</h2> <p>Every plant has certain characteristics and will behave a certain way when provided a unit step input. For example, the plant,</p> <p>\begin{equation} \frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{0.5}{0.1s + 1} \label{eqn:example_eq} \end{equation}</p> <p>will have a steady state value of \(0.5\) (because \(K=0.5\)) for unit step input.</p> <p>If, instead, we want to have a steady state value of \(1\) for the same unit step input, we can’t always change the plant itself. Therefore, we use a controller instead to “control” the output of the system. The controller is placed in cascade (in series) with the plant as shown below.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2020-02-21-controls-controllers/controller.png" alt="Controller and plant in open-loop configuration." width="600px"> <br> <em>Figure 1: Controller and plant in an open-loop configuration.</em> </p> <p>To change the system in Equation \ref{eqn:example_eq}, so that the output is \(1\) when input is a unit step function, we can multiply the plant with \(2\). The controller, therefore, is just a constant gain of value \(2\). This type of controller is called a “Proportional controller”, and is the simplest type of controller that can be used.</p> <h3 id="proportional-p-controller">Proportional \((P)\) controller</h3> <p>As mentioned before, \(P\) controller is the simplest type of controller that can be used. The output of a Proportional controller is proportional to the input of the controller. It is just a gain (can be positive or negative and can be a fraction) that is multiplied by the plant to modify its system response. A real-world example would be the use of an amplifier to amplify the sound from a speaker by a fixed amount. Figure 2 shows the output of the system in Equation \ref{eqn:example_eq} in open-loop configuration. The steady state value is \(0.5\) as expected.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2020-02-21-controls-controllers/withoutController.PNG" alt="Unit step response of the system." width="400px"> <br> <em>Figure 2: Unit step response of the system.</em> </p> <p>However, when a Proportional controller with a gain of \(2\) is used, the steady state value changes to \(1\), as shown in Figure 3.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2020-02-21-controls-controllers/withController.PNG" alt="Unit step response of the system with Proportional controller." width="400px"> <br> <em>Figure 3: Unit step response of the system with Proportional controller.</em> </p> <h3 id="integral-i-controller">Integral \((I)\) controller</h3> <p>The output of an Integral controller is proportional to the integral of the input to the controller. In terms of a closed-loop system, as shown in Figure 4, the output of the \(I\) controller is the integral of the error term. Integral controllers are useful because they cause the system to have zero steady state error. Integral controllers will also increase the type of a system i.e., a first-order system will become a second-order system, and a second-order system will become a third-order system, and so on.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2020-02-21-controls-controllers/integralController.PNG" alt="Closed-loop system with a PI controller." width="400px"> <br> <em>Figure 4: Closed-loop system with a PI controller.</em> </p> <h3 id="derivative-d-controller">Derivative \((D)\) controller</h3> <p>The output of a Derivative controller is proportional to the derivative of the input to the controller. In terms of a closed-loop system, the output of the \(D\) controller is the derivative of the error term. Derivative controllers are never used on their own and are usually paired with a \(P\) controller to make a \(PD\) controller, or a \(PI\) controller to make a \(PID\) controller. Derivative controllers are useful because they act as a dampener on the control effort. If the system is oscillating a lot, then the introduction of a derivative controller can damp those oscillations.</p> <h2 id="example-of-a-pi-controller">Example of a PI controller</h2> <p>Let us suppose that the plant we need to control is a first-order system with the following transfer function,</p> \[\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{2}{4s + 2}\] <p>We can calculate \(K=1\) and \(\tau=2\) as follows:</p> \[\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{2}{4s + 2} = \frac{\frac{2}{2}}{\frac{4s}{2} + \frac{2}{2}} = \frac{1}{2s + 1}\] <p>The closed-loop unit step response is shown in Figure 5.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2020-02-21-controls-controllers/exampleSystem.PNG" alt="The closed-loop unit step response of the system." width="400px"> <br> <em>Figure 5: The closed-loop unit step response of the system.</em> </p> <p>As you can see, the system reaches a steady state around \(6\)s. But what if you want the system to reach a steady state at or less than \(2\)s? And the maximum overshoot you can tolerate is \(5\%\)? These are called system requirements and are chosen by you, or are given to you by someone who wants you to design the controller. Let’s design a PI controller that will give us the desired performance.</p> <p>The system requirements are,</p> <ul> <li>Percentage Overshoot \((PO) \leq 5\%\)</li> <li>\(2\%\) Settling time \((t_s) \leq 3s\)</li> </ul> <p>First of all, we need to create a block diagram of the system.

This is because the calculation only provides a close guess of the required PI gains. After performing the calculation, the gains need to be manually tuned to get the desired system response. Upon manually tuning the \(P\) gain to \(8\), we get the desired system response as shown in Figure 10. The \(I\) gain was not changed.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2020-02-21-controls-controllers/PIgainsRight.PNG" alt="Correct result after tuning the PI gains." width="600px"> <br> <em>Figure 10: Correct result after tuning the PI gains.</em> </p> <p><strong>Note:</strong> The gains can also be manually tuned without performing the calculation. However, the time it takes to get the desired gains will vary. You might be able to find the gains very quickly, or it might take a very long time. Therefore, performing the calculations gives you a good starting guess and you can start tuning the gains from there.</p> <h2 id="pid-controllers-and-third-order-systems">PID controllers and third-order systems</h2> <p>The calculation of a third-order system follows in a similar way as a second-order system with a small difference. The block diagram of a plant with a PID controller is shown below.</p> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2020-02-21-controls-controllers/pid.PNG" alt="The PID controller with the plant." width="400px"> <br> <em>Figure 11: The PID controller with the plant.</em> </p> <h3 id="calculating-the-pid-gains">Calculating the PID gains</h3> <p>The block diagram shown in Figure 11 can be reduced similarly as shown for the PI controller but with three variables i.e., \(P\), \(I\), and \(D\) gains. If the plant is a second-order system (as shown in Figure 11), then the overall transfer function will result in a third-order system. Since we only know how to solve for a second-order system, we do a little trick. The transfer function of Figure 11 is shown below:</p> \[\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{\frac{Ds^2+Ps+I}{2}}{s^3 + s^2\frac{(1+D)}{2} + s\frac{P}{2} + \frac{I}{2}}\] <p>Since we know that a third-order system has 3 poles, we choose one of the poles and then calculate the rest of the two poles using the system requirements (Percentage overshoot and Settling time).</p> <h4 id="choosing-the-third-pole">Choosing the third pole</h4> <p>To explain the choice of a pole, let us take an example transfer function and see how its poles and zeros (the roots of the denominator and numerator, respectively) look like in the s-plane. In the figure below, the root locus for a third-order system with the following transfer function is shown:</p> \[\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{s+1}{s^3 + 57s^2 + 360s + 500}\] <p>The system has poles at \(-2\), \(-5\), and \(-50\) and a zero at \(-1\).</p> <p align="center"> <img src="/assets/img/posts/2020-02-21-controls-controllers/PIDrootLocus.PNG" alt="Root locus of a third-order system with poles at $$-2$$, $$-5$$, and $$-50$$ and a zero at $$-1$$." width="400px"> <br> <em>Figure 12: Root locus of a third-order system with poles at \(-2\), \(-5\), and \(-50\) and a zero at \(-1\).</em> </p> <p>Any third-order system behaves like a second-order system if one of the three poles of the system (the order of the system tells how many poles it has) is to the far left of the imaginary axis.</p> <p>In the example shown in Figure 12, the third pole at \(-50\) is very far to the left of the imaginary axis and therefore, has minimal effect on the system response. The nearer a pole is to the imaginary axis, the more impact it has on the system response.</p> <p>With this knowledge, and the knowledge that the characteristic equation of a second-order system is as follows,</p> \[s^2 + 2\omega_n \zeta s + {\omega_n}^2\] <p>we can write down the characteristic equation of the third-order system. We can imagine a third pole more than \(5\) times that of the other two poles and place it at the far left of the imaginary axis. The resulting equation is,</p> \[(s-\alpha)(s^2 + 2\omega_n \zeta s + {\omega_n}^2)\] <p>where \(\alpha\) is the pole that we choose. We can choose an arbitrarily large negative value such as \(-100\), or we can choose \(\alpha\) to be \(-\omega\zeta\). In either case, we have a third pole that will not affect the system response too much and will allow us to approximate the third-order system as a second-order system.
